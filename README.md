# This repository is for our class, CSC3380 (Object-Oriented Design) at Lousiana State University. #  
  
Our project for this semester is the creation of an app, **Got to Geaux?**, for Android.  
We will use Microsoft's [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) and [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/)'s shared code platform for the development of our app.  
  

**Got to Geaux?** will allow for users to locate and review bathrooms in their area.
